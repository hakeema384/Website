                <h1>Who is Suzanne Collins?</h1>
                <p>Suzanne Collins is an American author who published her debut book, Gregor the Overlander, the first of the five-part The Underland Chronicles, in 2003. 
                In 2008, her first book of The Hunger Games series was published. The best-selling trilogy was adapted into a blockbuster film series starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.<br>
                While The Underland Chronicles made Collins a well-known author, it was her next series that ratcheted up her celebrity status. As Collins later recalled, The Hunger Games trilogy was born while she was watching television late one night.
                Flipping through the channels, Collins was suddenly struck by the lack of distinction between reality TV and coverage of the Iraq war: "We have so much programming coming at us all the time," she says. "Is it too much? Are we becoming desensitized to the entire experience? ... I can't believe a certain amount of that isn't happening."
